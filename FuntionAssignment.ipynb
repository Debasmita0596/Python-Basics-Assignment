        "#6. Improved Concurrency:\n",
        "#Asynchronous Programming: Generators can be used in asynchronous programming models (like async and await in Python), making it easier to write non-blocking code that can handle I/O operations efficiently.\n",
        "#7. Flexibility:\n",
        "#Infinite Sequences: Generators can produce an infinite series of values (like Fibonacci numbers) without requiring an upper limit. This is not feasible with regular functions that return collections.\n",
