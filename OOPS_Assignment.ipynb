        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a datatype by bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that work on the data into a single unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Object: An instance of a class. It represents a specific implementation of a class with actual data, and through it, you can interact with the methods and attributes defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: The concept of restricting access to certain components of an object. This is achieved by bundling the data and the methods that manipulate the data together and using access modifiers like private, protected, and public to control access.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: The mechanism by which one class (child or subclass) inherits properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent or superclass). This allows code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: The ability to present the same interface or behavior in different forms. This can be achieved through method overloading (same method name with different parameters) or method overriding (subclass changes the implementation of a method defined in a superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts form the foundation of OOP and enable the creation of modular, reusable, and maintainable code.\n",

        "#Explanation:\n",
        "#Static Method is_leap_year():\n",
        "\n",
        "#The method is defined using the @staticmethod decorator, indicating that it does not require access to instance or class variables.\n",
        "#It takes a single argument year and checks whether it is a leap year based on the defined rules.\n",
        "#Leap Year Logic:\n",
        "\n",
        "#The logic checks if the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100 (unless it is also divisible by 400).\n",
        "#It returns True if the year is a leap year and False otherwise.\n",
        "#Example Usage:\n",
        "\n",
        "#The static method is called directly on the class YearChecker, demonstrating that it can be used without creating an instance of the class.\n",
        "#Several years are checked, and the results are printed.\n",
        "#Output:\n",
        "#When WE run the code, the output will be:\n",
        "\n",
        "#2024 is a leap year.\n",
        "#1900 is not a leap year.\n",
        "#2000 is a leap year.\n",
        "#Summary:\n",
        "#This implementation demonstrates how to create a static method in a class to check if a given year is a leap year. It highlights the utility of static methods for functions that operate independently of the instance or class state.\n"
