It's a powerful feature for manipulating strings, enabling you to retrieve substrings or modify strings efficiently. Here’s a detailed look at how string slicing works:\n","\n","#Basic Syntax\n","#The basic syntax for string slicing is:\n","\n","\n","#substring = string[start:stop:step]\n","\n","#start: The index where the slice starts (inclusive). If omitted, defaults to the beginning of the string.\n","#stop: The index where the slice ends (exclusive). If omitted, defaults to the end of the string.\n","#step: The interval between indices. If omitted, defaults to 1 (every character).\n","#Examples\n","#Basic Slicing\n","\n","\n","text = \"Hello, World!\"\n","# Extracting \"Hello\"\n","substring = text[0:5]  # Start at index 0, up to but not including index 5\n","print(substring)  # Output: Hello\n","#Omitting start and stop\n","\n","\n","text = \"Python Programming\"\n","# Extracting \"Python Programming\"\n","substring = text[:]  # From start to end\n","print(substring)  # Output: Python Programming\n","#Using step\n","\n","\n","text = \"Hello, World!\"\n","# Extracting every second character\n","substring = text[::2]  # From start to end, stepping by 2\n","print(substring)  # Output: Hlo ol!\n","#Negative Indexing\n","\n","\n","text = \"Hello, World!\"\n","# Extracting \"World\"\n","substring = text[-6:-1]  # Start from index -6 up to but not including index -1\n","print(substring)  # Output: World\n","#Reverse a String\n","\n","\n","text = \"Hello, World!\"\n","# Reversing the string\n","reversed_text = text[::-1]  # Step by -1 to reverse the string\n","print(reversed_text)  # Output: !dlroW ,olleH\n","#Combining Slicing Techniques\n","\n","\n","text = \"Programming in Python\"\n","# Extracting \"in\" from the string\n","substring = text[12:14]  # Start at index 12, up to but not including index 14\n","print(substring)  # Output: in\n","\n","#Important Points\n","#Indexing: Python uses zero-based indexing, so the first character is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on. Negative indices count from the end of the string.\n","#Out of Range: If start or stop indices are out of range, Python handles it gracefully. For example, text[100:] will just return an empty string if text is shorter than 100 characters.\n","#Step Values: The step value can be negative, which is useful for reversing a portion of the string.\n","#String slicing is versatile and can be used for a wide range of string manipulation tasks. Whether you're extracting specific parts of a string, reversing it, or skipping characters, slicing provides a clean and efficient way to accomplish these tasks.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"1RThYBB4Avdc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1726142826875,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":520,"user":{"displayName":"Debasmita Deb","userId":"10419912521201974222"}},"outputId":"5bf3edc3-f3b0-42da-916a-36e517da529f"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello\n","Python Programming\n","Hlo ol!\n","World\n","!dlroW ,olleH\n","in\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Explain the key features of lists in python\n","#Lists in Python are versatile, mutable sequences that are widely used for storing and managing collections of items.

Converting a list to a set eliminates duplicate entries automatically.\n","#Example: Cleaning a list of user IDs to ensure each ID is unique.\n","\n","\n","user_ids = [101, 102, 103, 101, 104, 105, 102]\n","unique_user_ids = set(user_ids)\n","print(unique_user_ids)  # Output: {101, 102, 103, 104, 105}\n","#Membership Testing\n","\n","#Use Case: Sets are optimized for membership testing. Checking if an item is in a set is very fast (average O(1) time complexity), making sets ideal for scenarios where you need to perform frequent membership tests.\n","#Example: Verifying if a user is authorized to access certain features.\n","\n","\n","authorized_users = {\"alice\", \"bob\", \"carol\"}\n","print(\"alice\" in authorized_users)  # Output: True\n","print(\"dave\" in authorized_users)   # Output: False\n","#Mathematical Set Operations\n","\n","#Use Case: Sets support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. These operations are useful for handling and analyzing relationships between groups of data.\n","#Example: Finding common elements between two lists of student IDs or determining which students are only in one of two classes.\n","\n","\n","class_a = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n","class_b = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n","\n","# Students in either class\n","all_students = class_a | class_b\n","print(all_students)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n","\n","# Students in both classes\n","common_students = class_a & class_b\n","print(common_students)  # Output: {3, 4}\n","#Data Deduplication in Data Processing\n","\n","#Use Case: In data processing tasks, sets can be used to efficiently handle large datasets by removing duplicates and performing set operations like intersections and unions.\n","#Example: Finding unique words in a large text document.\n","\n","\n","text = \"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\n","unique_words = set(text.split())\n","print(unique_words)  # Output: {'the', 'quick', 'fox', 'over', 'jumps', 'dog', 'brown', 'lazy'}\n","#Efficient Storage and Retrieval\n","\n","#Use Case: Sets are suitable for scenarios where you need to manage a collection of unique items with fast insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.\n","#Example: Managing a list of unique customer IDs or tracking unique sessions in a web application.\n","\n","\n","active_sessions = {\"session1\", \"session2\", \"session3\"}\n","active_sessions.add(\"session4\")\n","print(active_sessions)  # Output: {'session1', 'session2', 'session3', 'session4'}\n","#Summary\n","#Tuples: Use them for immutable collections, returning multiple values from functions, ensuring data integrity, and lightweight record-keeping. They are also useful for hashable keys in dictionaries and sets.\n","#Sets: Use them for unique collections, membership testing, mathematical set operations, removing duplicates, and efficient storage and retrieval.\n","#Both tuples and sets are essential in Python programming, each serving different purposes based on their characteristics and the requirements of your application.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"zwjB2MU9bjL-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1726148568343,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":990,"user":{"displayName":"Debasmita Deb","userId":"10419912521201974222"}},"outputId":"9b0f0b20-c762-4468-ac03-f9d1de034075"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["3 1\n","1984 by George Orwell (1949)\n","Brave New World by Aldous Huxley (1932)\n","{101, 102, 103, 104, 105}\n","True\n","False\n","{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n","{3, 4}\n","{'over', 'dog', 'brown', 'lazy', 'the', 'fox', 'jumps', 'quick'}\n","{'session1', 'session2', 'session4', 'session3'}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Describe how to add, modify and delete items in a dictionary with examples.\n","#Dictionaries in Python are versatile and mutable data structures that store key-value pairs. Here’s how to add, modify, and delete items in a dictionary with examples:\n","\n","#1. Adding Items\n","#You can add items to a dictionary by assigning a value to a new key. If the key doesn’t already exist in the dictionary, it will be added.\n","\n","#Example:\n","\n","\n","\n","# Creating an empty dictionary\n","my_dict = {}\n","\n","# Adding items to the dictionary\n","my_dict['name'] = 'Alice'\n","my_dict['age'] = 30\n","my_dict['city'] = 'New York'\n","\n","print(my_dict)\n","# Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n","\n","# Adding another item\n","my_dict['job'] = 'Engineer'\n","print(my_dict)\n","# Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York', 'job': 'Engineer'}\n","#You can also add items using the update() method, which is useful when adding multiple items at once:\n","\n","#Example:\n","\n","\n","\n","# Adding multiple items using update\n","my_dict.update({'email': 'alice@example.com', 'phone': '123-456-7890'})\n","print(my_dict)\n","# Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York', 'job': 'Engineer', 'email': 'alice@example.com', 'phone': '123-456-7890'}\n","#2. Modifying Items\n","#To modify an item, simply assign a new value to an existing key. If the key exists, the value will be updated.\n","\n","#Example:\n","\n","\n","\n","# Creating a dictionary\n","my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n","\n","# Modifying an existing item\n","my_dict['age'] = 31\n","my_dict['city'] = 'Los Angeles'\n","\n","print(my_dict)\n","# Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31, 'city': 'Los Angeles'}\n","#You can also use the update() method to modify existing items and add new ones at the same time:\n","\n","#Example:\n","\n","\n","\n","# Modifying and adding items using update\n","my_dict.update({'age': 32, 'job': 'Manager'})\n","print(my_dict)\n","# Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 32, 'city': 'Los Angeles', 'job': 'Manager'}\n","#3. Deleting Items\n","#Items can be deleted from a dictionary using several methods:\n","\n","#a. Using del Statement\n","#The del statement removes a key-value pair from the dictionary.\n","\n","#Example:\n","\n","\n","\n","# Creating a dictionary\n","my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n","\n","# Deleting an item by key\n","del my_dict['city']\n","\n","print(my_dict)\n","# Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}\n","#b. Using pop() Method\n","#The pop() method removes a key-value pair and returns the value associated with the key. If the key is not found, it raises a KeyError, unless a default value is provided.\n","\n","#Example:\n","\n","\n","\n","# Creating a dictionary\n","my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n","\n","# Removing an item and getting its value\n","age = my_dict.pop('age')\n","print(age)        # Output: 30\n","print(my_dict)    # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'city': 'New York'}\n","\n","# Removing an item with a default value if key is not found\n","city = my_dict.pop('city', 'Not Found')\n","print(city)       # Output: 'New York'\n","print(my_dict)    # Output: {'name': 'Alice'}\n","#c. Using popitem() Method\n","#The popitem() method removes and returns the last key-value pair added to the dictionary as a tuple. If the dictionary is empty, it raises a KeyError.\n","\n","#Example:\n","\n","\n","\n","# Creating a dictionary\n","my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n","\n","# Removing and returning the last item\n","item = my_dict.popitem()\n","print(item)       # Output: ('city', 'New York')\n","print(my_dict)    # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}\n","#d.

The main reason for this is that dictionaries use a hashing mechanism to store and retrieve key-value pairs efficiently. The key's hash value is calculated and used to determine where the associated value is stored in memory. If a key could be modified after it was inserted, the hash would change, leading to inconsistencies in locating the correct value.\n","\n","#Key Reasons for Immutability:\n","#Hashing Requirement: Python dictionaries rely on a key’s hash value to perform lookups. Immutable objects like strings, numbers, and tuples have fixed hash values that won't change, ensuring that a key always points to the correct value in the dictionary.\n","\n","#Efficient Data Retrieval: Because the hash value is consistent, dictionary lookups are fast—usually O(1) time complexity. This performance advantage relies on the immutability of keys, ensuring that the hash value calculated during key insertion is the same one used during lookup.\n","\n","#Avoiding Key Corruption: If a mutable object, such as a list, were used as a dictionary key and it were modified, the dictionary would lose track of where the corresponding value is stored, which would result in incorrect lookups or even errors.\n","\n","#Examples\n","#Immutable key (string):\n","\n","\n","\n","my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}\n","print(my_dict[\"name\"])  # Outputs: Alice\n","#In this case, the key \"name\" is a string, which is immutable. Its hash value will remain constant, so the lookup works reliably.\n","\n","#Immutable key (tuple):\n","\n","\n","\n","coordinates = {(10, 20): \"Point A\", (30, 40): \"Point B\"}\n","print(coordinates[(10, 20)])  # Outputs: Point A\n","#Here, the tuple (10, 20) is immutable and can serve as a dictionary key. If tuples were mutable, modifying them would invalidate the dictionary's ability to retrieve the correct value.\n","\n","#Mutable object as a key (invalid):\n","\n","\n","my_dict = {[1, 2, 3]: \"List key\"}\n","# Raises TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n","\n","#In this example, Python raises a TypeError because lists are mutable and cannot be used as dictionary keys.\n","\n","#Immutable Objects Commonly Used as Dictionary Keys:\n","#Strings: \"hello\", \"key\"\n","#Numbers: 42, 3.14\n","#Tuples (containing only immutable elements): (1, 2, 3)\n","#Why Not Use Mutable Keys?\n","#If you could use mutable keys, the reliability of dictionary lookups would be compromised. For instance, if a list were used as a key and then modified after insertion, the dictionary would no longer be able to locate the correct key-value pair.\n","\n","#For example:\n","\n","\n","\n","my_dict = {[1, 2, 3]: \"List key\"}\n","my_key = [1, 2, 3]\n","my_key.append(4)\n","print(my_dict[my_key])  # This would result in an incorrect or failed lookup\n","#Conclusion\n","#The immutability of dictionary keys ensures the stability and efficiency of dictionary operations, including lookups and updates. It prevents errors related to key mutation, maintaining the integrity of the hash table structure that powers Python dictionaries.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"quCcRdRBf-bm"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
